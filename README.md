# LB Twitch Clip Length
 LioranBoard extension to retrieve the duration of any Twitch clip and automatically starts a timer to send an extension trigger (or through a defined max clip length). 
 Can be used to auto hide your browser source once the clip stops playing. 




**How to install an extension:**
1. Download the .lbe extension file
2. Click on Install Extension in your LioranBoard Receiver
3. Select the extension file you downloaded 
4. Select your default Transmitter you are using. Make 100% sure it is the correct one. 
5. Refresh your Transmitter or close and reopen Lioranboard Receiver. 
6. Most extensions include a premade deck with buttons. If you do not see one, create a new button, add "Send to Extensions" command and select the extension you just installed. If you can only see the extension name with no input fields, it means it was not installed correctly. Repeat steps above.
